# Formulate

Formulate lets you use Excell - like formula syntax in html tables.
To make a calculation, just use *=A1+B2+B3/B4* or similar formula in any cell of your table.

You can now use for example *SUM(A1:G34)* formula to calculate the sum of cells or *AVG(A1:G34)* to calculate avarage value.

If you want to see how it works - [See some examples and tests!](/example.php)
